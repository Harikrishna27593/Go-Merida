## Week 1:
### Core Value: Eliminating Waste

* We researched for high graphic games which is not necessary for this project. We then came to know that  low graphic game would do good.
* Came up with unity 3D, phaser, construct2 game engines and explored. We came to know we should put more time on developing the game which wonâ€™t really help us focus on the key area of our project i.e., the design patterns.

##  Design Pattern
Will choose after design pattern class

## Week 2:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Team considered MelonJS game engine and gone through it. Later team finalized greenfoot for game development. 
## Week 3:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Team brought up many images for setting back-ground to the game. Eliminated some images which team felt are not feasible for the game. 
## Week 4:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Some usecases are eliminated considering the timely delivery of the project. 
## Week 5:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Initially thought of different design patterns to implement the code but we came on for final 5 design pattern that make our code work.
## Week 6:
### Eliminating Waste:

* Team thought of many design patterns to be included in the code but finalised on 5 design patterns with which we can implement the code easily and eliminated other design patterns as they are feasiblee with our code.
