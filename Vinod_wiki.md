### Core Value: Eliminating Waste

* We researched for high graphic games which is not necessary for this project. We then came to know that  low graphic game would do good.
* Came up with unity 3D, phaser, construct2 game engines and explored. We came to know we should put more time on developing the game which wonâ€™t really help us focus on the key area of our project i.e., the design patterns.
