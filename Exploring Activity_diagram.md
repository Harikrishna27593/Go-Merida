The Activity Diagram is comprised of the following model elements.</br>
</br>
Initial State:</br>
</br>
An initial state is a model element that explicitly shows the beginning of a workflow on an
activity diagram. It is the point at which reading of the activity diagram begins. Because
activity diagram shows a sequence of actions, it must indicate the starting point of the
sequence using the initial state element.</br>
</br>
The initial state is drawn as a solid circle with an optional name or label.
</br>
</br>
Action:</br>
</br>
An Action is a model element that represents the performance of a task in a workflow or
operation. Each action must occur before the workflow continues to the next element on an
activity diagram. An action is a non-interruptible task that takes place during an activity.
Action may be nested - i.e. action may have sub-actions.</br></br>
Action is drawn as a capsule shaped rounded rectangle with a name or description
