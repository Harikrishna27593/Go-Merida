## XP Core Value - Feedback:
### Week #4<br>
The team gave inputs on usecases and flow of the game. The first decided on some usecases, out of which some usecases were not feasible to implement in the time frame that we have. This was proposed by on the teammates, and this feedback was taken into consideration and we dropped some use cases.

### Week #3<br>
The team gave inputs on game design and we chose an infinite loop game with levels. THe feedback from all the team members was taken into consideration for selecting the game design.

### Week #2<br>
This week, the team discussed and provided inputs on the game engine to use in implementation. We chose melon js and tried some libraries. But, the team found some difficulties. So, based on the feedback from each team member, we are planning to explore the tutorials on Greenfoot.

### Week #1<br>
* The first week meet started off with brainstorming about the game ideas. We first wanted to create a game where it included switching from one game concept to another - like a potpourri of games - and provide an adventure where the user cannot anticipate the game in the next level.<br> 
* Team members provided feedback that it would be a challenge to implement multiple game scenarios with the time constraint. <br>
* Based on the team feedback, we decided on implementing a single theme throughout the game.<br>
