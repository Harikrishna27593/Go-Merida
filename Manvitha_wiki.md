## XP Core Value - Feedback:
### Week #1<br>
* The first week meet started off with brainstorming about the game ideas. We first wanted to create a game where it included switching from one game concept to another - like a potpourri of games - and provide an adventure where the user cannot anticipate the game in the next level.<br> 
* Team members provided feedback that it would be a challenge to implement multiple game scenarios with the time constraint. <br>
* Based on the team feedback, we decided on implementing a single theme throughout the game.<br> 

### Week #2<br>
This week, the team discussed and provided inputs on the game engine to use in implementation. We chose melon js and tried some libraries. But, the team found some difficulties. So, based on the feedback from each team member, we are planning to explore the tutorials on Greenfoot.
