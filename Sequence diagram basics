Sequence diagram shows different parts of a system work in a ‘sequence’ to get something done.

Lifeline Notation: 

A sequence diagram is made up of several of these lifeline notations that should be arranged horizontally across the top of the diagram.
No two lifeline notations should overlap each other.They represent the different objects or parts that interact with each other in the system during the sequence.

Activation bar: 

Activation bar is the box placed on the lifeline.  It is used to indicate that an object is active (or instantiated) during an interaction
between two objects. The length of the rectangle indicates the duration of the objects staying active.

Message Arrows:

An arrow from the Message Caller to the Message Receiver specifies a message in a sequence diagram. A message can flow in any direction
from left to right, right to left or back to the Message Caller itself. While you can describe the message being sent from one object to 
the other on the arrow, with different arrowheads you can indicate the type of message being sent or received. When an object sends a 
message to itself, it is called a reflexive message. It is indicated with a message arrow that start and ends at the same lifeline like 
shown in the example below.

Comment:

UML diagrams generally permit the annotation of comments in all UML diagram types. The comment object is a rectangle with a folded-over corner
as shown below. The comment can be linked to the related object with a dashed line.
