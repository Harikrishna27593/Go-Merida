### WEEK-1</br>
####  XP Core Value - Communication</br>
* All the team members discussed and decided to meet after performing some initial research on some gaming options to decide on the game to be built for the project</br>
* Based on our research we came up with ideas for the game. We brainstormed and criticized the different options based on user experience on the gaming options and narrowed to 2-3 gaming ideas. We decided to finalize on the game from among these options based on further research on implementation.</br>
* For the ease of quicker communications and collaboration among the team members, we started using the instant messaging system â€“ SLACK</br>
* Also, for clarity of discussion during the team meetings, we projected one of the systems on to a central screen</br>
* We decided on the team stand-up meetings</br>
